## Introduction
Extracting specific parts of a text string is a common task in Excel. This guide covers how to extract text before, after, or between characters using built-in functions like `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`, `FIND`, and `LEN`.

> [!NOTE]
> These techniques are essential for data cleaning, parsing, and transformation.

## Core Functions

| Function | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LEFT`   | Extracts a specified number of characters from the start of a text string. |
| `RIGHT`  | Extracts a specified number of characters from the end of a text string.   |
| `MID`    | Extracts a specified number of characters from a text string, starting at a specified position. |
| `FIND`   | Returns the position of a specified character or substring within a text string. |
| `LEN`    | Returns the length of a text string.                                       |

## Extracting Text Before a Character

### Syntax
```excel
=LEFT(text, FIND(character, text) - 1)
```

### Explanation
- `LEFT(text, num_chars)`: Extracts `num_chars` from the start of `text`.
- `FIND(character, text)`: Locates the position of `character` in `text`.
- Subtract 1 to exclude the character itself.

### Example
**Input:** `A1 = "username@example.com"`
**Goal:** Extract "username"

```excel
=LEFT(A1, FIND("@", A1) - 1)
```
**Output:** `"username"`

## Extracting Text After a Character

### Syntax
```excel
=MID(text, FIND(character, text) + 1, LEN(text))
```

### Explanation
- `MID(text, start_num, num_chars)`: Extracts `num_chars` from `text`, starting at `start_num`.
- `FIND(character, text) + 1`: Starts extraction after the character.
- `LEN(text)`: Ensures all remaining characters are included.

### Example
**Input:** `A1 = "username@example.com"`
**Goal:** Extract "example.com"

```excel
=MID(A1, FIND("@", A1) + 1, LEN(A1))
```
**Output:** `"example.com"`

## Extracting Text Between Two Characters

### Syntax
```excel
=MID(text, FIND(first_char, text) + 1, FIND(second_char, text) - FIND(first_char, text) - 1)
```

### Explanation
- `FIND(first_char, text) + 1`: Starts extraction after the first character.
- `FIND(second_char, text) - FIND(first_char, text) - 1`: Calculates the number of characters to extract.

### Example
**Input:** `A1 = "John (Doe)"`
**Goal:** Extract "Doe"

```excel
=MID(A1, FIND("(", A1) + 1, FIND(")", A1) - FIND("(", A1) - 1)
```
**Output:** `"Doe"`

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Extract Domain from Email
**Input:** `A1 = "support@company.com"`
**Goal:** Extract "company.com"

```excel
=MID(A1, FIND("@", A1) + 1, LEN(A1))
```
**Output:** `"company.com"`

### Example 2: Extract First Name from Full Name
**Input:** `A1 = "Smith, John"`
**Goal:** Extract "John"

```excel
=MID(A1, FIND(", ", A1) + 2, LEN(A1))
```
**Output:** `"John"`

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting

| Error                     | Cause                                      | Solution                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `#VALUE!`                 | Character not found in the text.           | Ensure the character exists in the text. Use `IFERROR` to handle errors. |
| Incorrect extraction      | Wrong position or length calculation.     | Double-check the `FIND` and `LEN` logic.                                |
| Extra spaces in output    | Input text has leading/trailing spaces.    | Use `TRIM` to remove extra spaces.                                      |

> [!WARNING]
> Always test your formulas with edge cases (e.g., empty cells, missing characters).

---

## Best Practices

- **Use `IFERROR`:** Handle cases where the character is not found.
  ```excel
  =IFERROR(LEFT(A1, FIND("@", A1) - 1), "Character not found")
  ```
- **Combine with `TRIM`:** Remove extra spaces.
  ```excel
  =TRIM(MID(A1, FIND("(", A1) + 1, FIND(")", A1) - FIND("(", A1) - 1))
  ```
- **Dynamic Ranges:** Use tables or named ranges for dynamic data.

> [!TIP]
> For complex extractions, consider using `TEXTBEFORE` and `TEXTAFTER` (Excel 365).

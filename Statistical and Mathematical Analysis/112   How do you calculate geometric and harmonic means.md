### 112. **How do you calculate geometric and harmonic means?**

**Geometric Mean:**
=GEOMEAN(number1, number2, ...)
Use for: Growth rates, ratios, percentages
Example: =GEOMEAN(1.05, 1.08, 1.12) for average growth rate

**Harmonic Mean:**
=HARMEAN(number1, number2, ...)
Use for: Rates, speeds, ratios
Example: =HARMEAN(60, 40) for average speed of round trip

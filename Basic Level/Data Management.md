### Data Management

**How do you remove duplicates?**

1. Select your data range
2. Go to Data tab → Remove Duplicates
3. Choose which columns to check for duplicates
4. Click OK (Excel keeps the first occurrence)

**How do you freeze panes?**

1. Select the cell below and to the right of where you want the freeze
2. Go to View tab → Freeze Panes
3. Choose Freeze Panes, Freeze Top Row, or Freeze First Column

**Difference between sorting and filtering:**

- **Sorting** rearranges all data permanently in ascending/descending order
- **Filtering** temporarily hides rows that don't meet criteria while keeping data structure intact

**Find & Replace:**
Press Ctrl+H, enter text to find and replacement text, choose scope (sheet/workbook), and replace selectively or all at once

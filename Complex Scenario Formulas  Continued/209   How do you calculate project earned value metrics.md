### 209. **How do you calculate project earned value metrics?**

**Planned Value (PV):**
=Budget_at_Completion * Planned_Percent_Complete

**Earned Value (EV):**
=Budget_at_Completion * Actual_Percent_Complete

**Actual Cost (AC):**
=SUM(Actual_Costs_to_Date)

**Schedule Variance (SV):**
=EV - PV
(Positive = ahead of schedule)

**Cost Variance (CV):**
=EV - AC
(Positive = under budget)

**Schedule Performance Index (SPI):**
=EV / PV
(>1 = ahead of schedule)

**Cost Performance Index (CPI):**
=EV / AC
(>1 = under budget)

**Estimate at Completion (EAC):**
=BAC / CPI
(Assuming current performance continues)

**Estimate to Complete (ETC):**
=EAC - AC

**To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI):**
=(BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)
(CPI needed for remaining work to meet budget)

**Variance at Completion (VAC):**
=BAC - EAC

### 2. **What is the order of operations in Excel?**

PEMDAS (same as mathematics):

1. **P**arentheses ()
2. **E**xponents ^
3. **M**ultiplication * and **D**ivision / (left to right)
4. **A**ddition + and **S**ubtraction - (left to right)

Example: =2+3*4 returns 14 (not 20), because multiplication happens first

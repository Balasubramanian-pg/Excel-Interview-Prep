### 49. **What's the difference between NPV and PV?**

- **PV**: Calculates present value of constant periodic payments
- **NPV**: Calculates net present value of variable cash flows, assumes first payment at end of first period
- For cash flow at time 0, add it separately: =Initial_Investment + NPV(rate, future_cashflows)

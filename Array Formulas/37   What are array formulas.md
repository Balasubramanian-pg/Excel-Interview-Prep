### 37. **What are array formulas?**

Formulas that perform calculations on arrays (multiple values) simultaneously. In older Excel, press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to create them (shows curly braces {}). In Excel 365, they're dynamic and automatic.

Example: =SUM(A1:A10*B1:B10)
Multiplies each pair then sums (no helper column needed)

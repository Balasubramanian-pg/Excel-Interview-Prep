### 150. **How do you use EVALUATE and Name Manager for efficiency?**

**Create named constants:**
Name: TaxRate, Refers to: =0.0825

**Create named formulas:**
Name: TopSales, Refers to: =LARGE(Sales,5)

**Dynamic named ranges:**
Name: SalesRange, Refers to: =OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$1,0,0,COUNTA(Sheet1!$A:$A),1)

**Use names in formulas:** =TaxRate * A1
Clearer and easier to update centrally

These cover virtually every formula scenario you'll encounter in Excel interviews and real-world applications! Would you like me to:

1. Create practice exercises for any of these topics?
2. Explain specific industry applications (finance, sales, HR, etc.)?
3. Cover VBA integration with formulas?
4. Discuss Power Query M language in more depth?
